# UML Generator for Java

In software development, planning and implementation rarely align perfectly. Diagrams created early in the process can quickly become outdatedâ€”relationships shift, fields and methods change, and classes are deprecated or removed. **UML Generator for Java** bridges that gap by creating UML diagrams directly from your source code, ensuring you always have accurate, up-to-date representations that reflect the real structure of your project.

## Features
- **Generate UML from File or Folder**  
  Right-click on a Java file or folder in the Explorer to instantly generate UML.
- **Accurate Parsing**  
  Powered by a custom UML parser built with **JavaParser AST** for precise extraction of:
  - Classes
  - Interfaces
  - Attributes (with visibility modifiers)
  - Methods (with visibility modifiers)
  - Optional relationships
- **PlantUML Output**  
  Produces valid `.puml` files with `@startuml` and `@enduml` tags.
- **Custom Output Directory**  
  Choose where generated `.puml` files are saved. (currently produced at the root directory of the project to a folder, "output")
- **Automatic Preview**  
  Opens the generated file automatically in VS Code.
- **Integration-Ready**  
  Works seamlessly with PlantUML Preview extensions or external PlantUML renderers.

## Installation
1. Install from the VS Code Marketplace:  
   [UML Generator for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=0SMA0.uml-generator)

## Usage

### Generate from File
1. Right-click on a `.java` file in the Explorer.
2. Select **"Generate UML from File"**.
3. The `.puml` file will be created in the specified output directory.

### Generate from Folder
1. Right-click on a folder containing Java files.
2. Select **"Generate UML from Folder"**.
3. All Java files in that folder will be parsed and included in the diagram.

### Open in PlantUML Preview
After generation, open the `.puml` file in any PlantUML-compatible previewer to view the diagram.

## Future Features
- Downloading the diagrams
- Add stereotypes such as `ConcreteVisitor`, `Visitor`, `Element`, `Invoker`, `Action`, etc.
- Derive sequence diagrams from `main()`.
- Integrate AI assistance for designing according to functional and non-functional requirements.
- Support additional text-based diagramming tools such as Mermaid.
- Add support for other programming languages.
